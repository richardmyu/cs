### Course Overview 概论

Calculus is a foundational course at MIT; it plays an important role in the understanding of science, engineering, economics, and computer science, among other disciplines. This introductory calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications. Topics include:

- Concepts of Function, Limits and Continuity 函数的概念，极限和连续
- Differentiation Rules, Application to Graphing, Rates, Approximations, and Extremum Problems 微分规则及其在图形、比率、近似和极值问题中的应用

## Course Goals

After completing this course, students should have developed a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of single variable calculus and a range of skills allowing them to work effectively with the concepts.

The basic concepts are:

1. Derivatives as rates of change, computed as a limit of ratios
2. Integrals as a “sum,” computed as a limit of Riemann sums

After completing this course, students should demonstrate competency in the following skills:

Use both the limit definition and rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.
Sketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, the derivative test for increasing/decreasing functions, and concavity.
Apply differentiation to solve applied max/min problems.
Apply differentiation to solve related rates problems.
Evaluate integrals both by using Riemann sums and by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Apply integration to compute arc lengths, volumes of revolution and surface areas of revolution.
Evaluate integrals using advanced techniques of integration, such as inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.
Use L’Hospital’s rule to evaluate certain indefinite forms.
Determine convergence/divergence of improper integrals and evaluate convergent improper integrals.
Determine the convergence/divergence of an infinite series and find the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point.
Course Structure
This course, designed for independent study, has been organized to follow the sequence of topics covered in an MIT course on Single Variable Calculus. The content is organized into five major units:

Differentiation
Applications of Differentiation
The Definite Integral and its Applications
Techniques of Integration
Exploring the Infinite
Each unit has been further divided into parts (A, B, C, etc.), with each part containing a sequence of sessions. Because each session builds on knowledge from previous sessions, it is important you progress through the sessions in order. Each session covers an amount you might expect to complete in one sitting.

Within each unit you will be presented with sets of problems at strategic points, so you can test your understanding of the material. As you begin each part of a unit, review the problem set at its end so that you may work toward solving those problems as you learn new material.

MIT expects its students to spend about 150 hours on this course. More than half of that time is spent preparing for class and doing assignments. It’s difficult to estimate how long it will take you to complete the course, but you can probably expect to spend an hour or more working through each individual session.
