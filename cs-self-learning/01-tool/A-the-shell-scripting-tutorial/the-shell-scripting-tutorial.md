## Philosophy

There are a number of factors which can go into good, clean, quick, shell scripts.

- The most important criteria must be a clear, readable layout.
- Second is avoiding unnecessary commands.

You may be forgiven for thinking that with a simple script, this is not too significant a problem, but two things here are worth bearing in mind.

1. First, a simple script will, more often than anticipated, grow into a large, complex one.
2. Secondly, if nobody else can understand how it works, you will be lumbered with maintaining it yourself for the rest of your life!
